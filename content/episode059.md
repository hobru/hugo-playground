## Introduction

In Episode 59 of the SAP on Azure Video Podcast we talk about SAP on Azure Network connectivity and security, Going passwordless, Learning ABAP, RPA for SAP GUI using Power Automate Desktop, deploying production S/4HANA systems using SAP Cloud Appliance Library and a customer success story from thyssenKrupp Steel Europe on Azure. Then Robert takes another look at the Cloud Adoption Framework, looking back at several episodes in the past and providing some interesting new insights on what to consider when moving from on-premises to Microsoft Azure.
