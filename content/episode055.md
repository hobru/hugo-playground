## Introduction

In Episode 55 of the SAP on Azure Video Podcast we talk about BTP High availability setups, resizing peered Azure virtual networks, GitHub Codespaces, Logic App & SAP and look at using Azure NetApp Files for the SAP Global transport directory. Then Bartosz Jarkowski introduces us to his latest blog post series on the SAP Community Network about using OData services with Azure Synapse Pipelines. He is even doing a live publication of his latest episode: Part 6 – Introduction to delta extraction.
