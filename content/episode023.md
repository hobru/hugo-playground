## Introduction

In the 23rd episode of our unofficial SAP on Azure video podcast we are looking at the previously created content, talk about deploying SAP ASC/ERS with Azure Files NFS, look at several tutorials on the Developers.sap.com pages, talk about SAP ByDesign and Teams integration and look at SAPs upcoming event RISE. Then our expert Daniel Meixner talks about Azure DevOps with SAP Cloud Platform.
