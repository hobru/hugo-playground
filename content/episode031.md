## Introduction

In the 31st episode of our unofficial SAP on Azure video podcast we are looking at Ignite 2021 covering the Book of News, Microsoft Mesh, lots of Azure Infrastructure topic, Datacenter with Mark Russinovich, Project Bicepts, Azure Development with Donovan Brown, new M-Series, Power Platform, including Power Automate Desktop, CONA Whitepaper, and SAPs Integration promise. Then we hand over to Martin Räpple who explains and demos the Single Sign-On from Microsoft Teams via SAP Business Technology Platform to an SAP System on-premises.
