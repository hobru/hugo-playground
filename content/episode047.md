## Introduction

In Episode #47 of the SAP on Azure video podcast (recorded just before the Windows 11 event) we talk about NFS support for Azure Blob Storage, the upcoming Azure Hybrid and Multicloud Digital Event, learning PyTorch with Microsoft Learn, a new openSAP course about SAP Integration Suite and Boosting Microsoft response to cybersecurity attacks with Microsoft Azure Sentinel. Then we have Yoav Daniely & Koby Mymon showing us in detail about Microsoft Azure Sentinel for SAP solution.
