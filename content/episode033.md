## Introduction

In the 33rd episode of our unofficial SAP on Azure video podcast we are looking at the Availability Zones in every country, Low-Code/No-Code Development, Forrester Wave for RPA, openSAP hitting 5 million course enrollments, RISE with SAP and a new SAP on Azure Talk podcast. Then we drill into the backend behind the Power App that is used by the Azure FastTrack team to manage SAP systems.
